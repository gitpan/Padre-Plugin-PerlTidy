NAME
    Padre::Plugin::PerlTidy - Format perl files using Perl::Tidy

SYNOPIS
    This is a simple plugin to run Perl::Tidy on your source code.

    Currently there are no customisable options (since the Padre plugin
    system doesn't support that yet) - however Perl::Tidy will use your
    normal .perltidyrc file if it exists (see Perl::Tidy documentation).

INSTALLATION
    You can install this module like any other Perl module and it will
    become available in your Padre editor. However, you can also choose to
    install it into your user's Padre configuration directory only:

    *   Install the prerequisite modules.

    *   perl Makefile.PL

    *   make

    *   make installplugin

    This will install the plugin as PerlTidy.par into your user's
    ~/.padre/plugins directory.

    Similarly, "make plugin" will just create the PerlTidy.par which you can
    then copy manually.
