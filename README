NAME
    Padre::Plugin::PerlTidy - Format perl files using Perl::Tidy

SYNOPIS
    This is a simple plugin to run Perl::Tidy on your source code.

    Currently there are no customisable options (since the Padre plugin
    system doesn't support that yet) - however Perl::Tidy will use your
    normal .perltidyrc file if it exists (see Perl::Tidy documentation).
